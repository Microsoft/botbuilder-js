This sample shows a simple echo bot with conversation state tracking and demonstrates the bot working as a console app using the console adapter.

## To try this sample
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js.git
```


### Visual studio code
- open `samples\echobot-console-es6` folder
- Bring up a terminal, navigate to `samples\echobot-console-es6` folder
- type `npm install` to install the sample's dependencies
- type `npm start` to run the bot

# What is a bot?
A bot is an app that users interact with in a conversational way using text, graphics (cards), or speech. It may be a simple question and answer dialog, or a sophisticated bot that allows people to interact with services in an intelligent manner using pattern matching, state tracking and artificial intelligence techniques well-integrated with existing business services.

# Adapters
Adapters such as the [ConsoleAdapter](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/doc/botbuilder/classes/botbuilder.consoleadapter.md) and [BotFrameworkAdapter](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/doc/botbuilder/classes/botbuilder.botframeworkadapter.md) provide an abstraction for your bot to work with a variety of environments.

A bot is directed by it's adapter, which can be thought of as the conductor for your bot. The adapter is responsible for directing incoming and outgoing communication, authentication, and so on. The adapter differs based on it's environment (the adapter internally works differently locally versus on Azure) but in each instance it achieves the same goal. 

In most situations we don't work with the adapter directly, such as when creating a bot from a template, but it's good to know it's there and what it does.
The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities to and receives activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an activity, the adapter wraps up everything about that activity, creates a [context object](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/doc/botbuilder/classes/botbuilder.turncontext.md), passes it to your bot's application logic, and sends responses generated by your bot back to the user's channel.
