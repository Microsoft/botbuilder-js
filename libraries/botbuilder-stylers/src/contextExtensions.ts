         * If your bot send a message with images and then immediately sends a message without
         * images, you run the risk of the client displaying your messages out of order. The
         * reason being that most clients want to copy the images you sent to a CDN for faster
         * rendering in the future.
         *
         * You can often avoid out of order messages by inserting a delay between the message
         * with images and the one without.
         *
         * **Usage Example**
         *
         * ```js
         * context.reply(hotelsFound)
         *        .delay(2000)
