###  sprintf

► **sprintf**(format: *`string`*, ...args: *`any`[]*): `string`



*Defined in node_modules/@types/sprintf-js/index.d.ts:83*



Returns a formatted string:

    string sprintf(string format, mixed arg1?, mixed arg2?, ...)

### Argument swapping

You can also swap the arguments. That is, the order of the placeholders doesn't have to match the order of the arguments. You can do that by simply indicating in the format string which arguments the placeholders refer to:

    sprintf('%2$s %3$s a %1$s', 'cracker', 'Polly', 'wants')

And, of course, you can repeat the placeholders without having to increase the number of arguments.

### Named arguments

Format strings may contain replacement fields rather than positional placeholders. Instead of referring to a certain argument, you can now refer to a certain key within an object. Replacement fields are surrounded by rounded parentheses - `(` and `)` - and begin with a keyword that refers to a key:

    var user = {
        name: 'Dolly',
    }
    sprintf('Hello %(name)s', user) // Hello Dolly

Keywords in replacement fields can be optionally followed by any number of keywords or indexes:

    var users = [
        {name: 'Dolly'},
        {name: 'Molly'},
        {name: 'Polly'},
    ]
    sprintf('Hello %(users[0].name)s, %(users[1].name)s and %(users[2].name)s', {users: users}) // Hello Dolly, Molly and Polly

Note: mixing positional and named placeholders is not (yet) supported

### Computed values

You can pass in a function as a dynamic value and it will be invoked (with no arguments) in order to compute the value on the fly.

    sprintf('Current date and time: %s', function() { return new Date().toString() })


**Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| format | `string`   |  - |
| args | `any`[]   |  - |





**Returns:** `string`

###  vsprintf

► **vsprintf**(format: *`string`*, args: *`any`[]*): `string`



*Defined in node_modules/@types/sprintf-js/index.d.ts:163*



Same as `sprintf` except it takes an array of arguments, rather than a variable number of arguments:

    string vsprintf(string format, array arguments?)

### Argument swapping

You can also swap the arguments. That is, the order of the placeholders doesn't have to match the order of the arguments. You can do that by simply indicating in the format string which arguments the placeholders refer to:

    sprintf('%2$s %3$s a %1$s', 'cracker', 'Polly', 'wants')

And, of course, you can repeat the placeholders without having to increase the number of arguments.

        name: 'Dolly',

    sprintf('Hello %(name)s', user) // Hello Dolly

    var users = [
        {name: 'Dolly'},
        {name: 'Molly'},
        {name: 'Polly'},
    ]
    sprintf('Hello %(users[0].name)s, %(users[1].name)s and %(users[2].name)s', {users: users}) // Hello Dolly, Molly and Polly
