# Interface: DialogResult


:package: **botbuilder-dialogs**

Result returned to the caller of one of the various stack manipulation methods and used to return the result from a final call to `DialogContext.end()` to the bots logic.

## Type parameters
#### T 

## Properties
<a id="active"></a>

###  active

**●  active**:  *`boolean`* 

*Defined in [libraries/botbuilder-dialogs/lib/dialogContext.d.ts:21](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/b50d910/libraries/botbuilder-dialogs/lib/dialogContext.d.ts#L21)*

###  result

**●  result**:  *`T`⎮`undefined`* 

*Defined in [libraries/botbuilder-dialogs/lib/dialogContext.d.ts:31](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/b50d910/libraries/botbuilder-dialogs/lib/dialogContext.d.ts#L31)*



Result returned by a dialog that was just ended. This will only be populated in certain cases:

*   The bot calls `dc.begin()` to start a new dialog and the dialog ends immediately.
*   The bot calls `dc.continue()` and a dialog that was active ends.

In all cases where it's populated, [active](#active) will be `false`.
